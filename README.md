##Flappy Bird

####Description

This is a very simple implementation of flappy bird using pygame. Basic features include

1. Game play
2. Score and level suppport
3. Difficulty increase based on game progress


#### Why
I am always curious about games and I thinkt this project is the first stepping stone to get to know more about building the future ones. 

Two reasons I would like to gain game development experience

1. Reinforcement learning
2. Develop my ambitious simulation ideas in the form of games ( More on this later )
